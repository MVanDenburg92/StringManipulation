This week there are three short scripts: one to capitalize portions of a string; one to parse and manipulate a multi-line string, and one to extract a portion of a string and return in a way that is more understandable.

------

#### Exercise 1
Write a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name, e.g.<br />
old_macdonald('macdonald') --> MacDonald <br />

Add your code to exercise1.py <br />
Note: there is a method called "capitalize." The syntax for it is 'macdonald'.capitalize() and it returns 'Macdonald'<br />

------
#### Exercise 2
The multi-line string was scraped from the National Weather Service Website.<br />
Edit exercise2.py to produce the output below using string manipulation techniques:

> _Tonight: Clear, Low: 55 F_  <br />
_Thursday: Sunny then Chance Showers, High: 77 F_  <br />
_Friday: Sunny, High: 73 F_  <br />
_Saturday: Mostly Sunny, High: 77 F_  <br />
_Sunday: Mostly Sunny, High: 71 F_  <br />


Note: Copy the code from exercise2.py in the edit mode to retain the multi-line string formatting. There should be 39 lines of code when pasted in Python IDLE.

------
#### Exercise 3
Write code to extract the latitude and longitude from the URL in exercise3.py<br />
Output should be text that reads:

> Latitude: 42.2509428<br />
Longitude: -71.8249939
